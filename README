"There was a sharp bang from the roof of the Corn Exchange, right at the 
climax of his impromptu speech; heads turned in alarm. Something had 
broken inside the spork factory, and stream of rainbow-hued plastic 
implements fountained towards the sky and clattered to the cobblestones on 
either side, like a harbinger of the postindustrial society to come. 
Workers and peasants alike stared in open-mouthed bewilderment at this 
astonishing display of productivity, then bent to scrabble in the muck for 
the brightly colored sporks of revolution."
